## 📊  Customer_Behavior_Analysis
Customer behavior analysis project featuring SQL-based data extraction, Python EDA, and an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights.

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer purchasing behavior to identify trends, patterns, and actionable business insights. The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis, dashboard creation, and reporting.

The goal is to demonstrate practical data analytics skills using Python, SQL, Power BI, and AI-assisted reporting tools.

## 🗂️ Dataset
* The dataset contains customer transaction and behavior-related information.

* It includes details such as customer attributes, purchase history, shipping type, discounts, and order values.

* The dataset was loaded and processed using Python and later stored in a MySQL database for structured querying

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
* Python – Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis

* Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn – Data manipulation and visualization

* MySQL – Writing and executing analytical SQL queries

* Power BI – Interactive dashboard creation

* Gamma AI – Presentation and report generation

* GitHub – Version control and project documentation

## 🔍 Project Workflow/Steps
1.Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas

2.Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data structure and patterns

3.Cleaned the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats

4.Exported cleaned data and loaded it into a MySQL database

5.Wrote SQL queries to answer key business questions

6.Connected MySQL to Power BI and built an interactive dashboard

7.Created a business report summarizing insights

8.Developed a presentation using Gamma AI for clear stakeholder communication

## 📈 Dashboard
* Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

  -> Customer segmentation

  ->Purchase behavior trends

  ->Shipping type comparisons

  ->Revenue and order insights

* The dashboard enables quick, data-driven decision-making.

  (Power BI file can be found in the repository)

## ✅ Key Results & Insights
* Identified key customer segments based on purchase behavior

* Analyzed the impact of shipping type and discounts on customer spending

* Highlighted top-performing products and customer groups

* Provided data-backed insights to support business strategy

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1.Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2.Install the required Python libraries listed in the project.

3.Run the Jupyter Notebook for EDA and data cleaning

4.Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL

5.Execute the SQL queries provided in the sql/ folder

6.Open the Power BI file and refresh data connection

7.Review the PDF report and presentation for insights

## 💼 Deliverables
* Jupyter Notebook for EDA and data cleaning

* SQL queries for analytical insights

* Power BI interactive dashboard

* PDF report and presentation generated using Gamma AI
